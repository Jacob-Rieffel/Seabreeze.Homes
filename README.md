# Seabreeze.Homes
A Live Website For A Client's Personalized Real Estate Lead Generation. 

  Initial consultation began 7/9/24. Seabreeze.Homes was then officially hosted on 8/6/24 after revisions and client satisfaction was guaranteed. 
  Client requested a landing page which included 3 calls to action. These included: "Buy" "Sell" and "More" tabs. I took the requests as well as client's goals and aligned them to create and brand themselves with a personalized website. The landing page boasts an animated CSS/JavaScript beach ball which highlights each tab on desktop and tablet. Mobile uses sequential highlighting to bring attention to clickable options. Lead generation has begun as of 8/6/2024. I, also, am currently involved in the marketing and all digital aspects of the business with the exception of client's brokerage.  
  My key roles: 
- UI/UX design to make site useable and readable. Designing the site with user-friendliness in mind.
- Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create animations, MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE 
- Consulting client(s) and receiving feedback from individuals whilst presenting a confident, hospitable, and personable attitude. This led to great communication and ultimate satisfaction of the client.
